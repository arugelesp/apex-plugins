## Calendar Heatmap Plugin

This is a region plugin used to display a yearly calendar heatmap, inspired by the GitHub contribution chart.

![Alt text](heatmap.png?raw=true "Heatmap Preview")

Installation:
- Install the plugin into APEX
- Compile the accompanying PL/SQL package specification and body into the database

Usage:
- Add a region to your page and set the region type to "Calendar Heatmap"
- Set the region source to an SQL query that returns one row per day. 
- The first column is required must be a date, the second column is also required and should be a numeric value. Optionally return a tooltip and a link.

```
select trunc(log_date) as the_date, count(*) as the_count, 'foo' as the_tooltip, null as the_link
from log_table
group by trunc(log_date)
```

- Since the region is intended to show the data for the last year (last 365 days), the query should restrict its results accordingly.
